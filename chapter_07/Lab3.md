### How to Develop MLPs for Time Series Forecasting (Part 2)

Multilayer Perceptrons, or MLPs for short, can be applied to time series
forecasting. A challenge
with using MLPs for time series forecasting is in the preparation of the
data. Specifically, lag
observations must be flattened into feature vectors. In this tutorial, you will discover how to
develop a suite of MLP models for a range of standard time series forecasting problems. The
objective of this tutorial is to provide standalone examples of each model on each type of time
series problem as a template that you can copy and adapt for your specific time series forecasting
problem. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a suite of Multilayer Perceptron
models for a range of standard time series forecasting problems. After completing this tutorial,
you will know:

- How to develop MLP models for univariate time series forecasting.

- How to develop MLP models for multivariate time series forecasting.

- How to develop MLP models for multi-step time series forecasting.
