### How to Develop CNNs for Time Series Forecasting (Part 2)

Convolutional Neural Network models, or CNNs for short, can be applied to time series
forecasting. There are many types of CNN models that can be used for each specific type of
time series forecasting problem. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a suite of
CNN models for a range of standard time series forecasting problems. The objective of this
tutorial is to provide standalone examples of each model on each type of time series problem as
a template that you can copy and adapt for your specific time series forecasting problem. After
completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to develop CNN models for univariate time series forecasting.
- How to develop CNN models for multivariate time series forecasting.
- How to develop CNN models for multi-step time series forecasting.

Let' s get started.

#### Lab Environment
Notebooks are ready to run. All packages have been installed. There is no requirement for any setup.

**Note:** Elev8ed Notebooks (powered by Jupyter) will be accessible at the port given to you by your instructor. Password for jupyterLab : `1234`

All Notebooks are present in `work/deep-learning-time-series-forecasting` folder.

You can access jupyter lab at `<host-ip>:<port>/lab/workspaces/lab5_CNNs_Time_Series_Forecasting_Part2`
