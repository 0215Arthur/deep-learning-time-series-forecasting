### How to Develop LSTMs for Time Series Forecasting (Part 2)

Long Short-Term Memory networks, or LSTMs for short, can be applied to time series forecasting.
There are many types of LSTM models that can be used for each specific type of time series
forecasting problem. In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a suite of LSTM models
for a range of standard time series forecasting problems. The objective of this tutorial is to
provide standalone examples of each model on each type of time series problem as a template
that you can copy and adapt for your specific time series forecasting problem.
After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- How to develop LSTM models for univariate time series forecasting.

- How to develop LSTM models for multivariate time series forecasting.

- How to develop LSTM models for multi-step time series forecasting.

Let' s get started.

#### Lab Environment
Notebooks are ready to run. All packages have been installed. There is no requirement for any setup.

**Note:** Elev8ed Notebooks (powered by Jupyter) will be accessible at the port given to you by your instructor. Password for jupyterLab : `1234`

All Notebooks are present in `work/deep-learning-time-series-forecasting` folder.

You can access jupyter lab at `<host-ip>:<port>/lab/workspaces/lab7_LSTMs_Time_Series_Forecasting_Part2`
